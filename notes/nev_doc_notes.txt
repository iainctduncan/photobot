Line 6: trailing "in this doc," seems like we stopped mid sentence?
Burn Image: for linux mint: (right click the .img file, and select "open with image writer"

Load into Pi: (Should maybe mention where in Pi the slot is?)

Alter the image to enable SSH:
 "on terminal in your host, get into the boot directory and execute: $ sudo touch ssh" might be hard for people to understand?
 Maybe mention the folder includes "kernel.img" is there an "open terminal here" option on mac

In installer, at drive setup, Nev entered "sda1" instead of just 1, and installer died because it didn't
get an int:

Enter drive number: sda1

Installer script, doesn't ask if you are using Lorex or Cannon/gphoto. Seems to install lorex stuff, but asks about gphoto tests.
installs gphoto version into crontab aswell, which I imagine will clog error log, since we aren't using it.

photobot_lorex.ini starts with capture_dir = /var/lorex should probably be /mnt/usbstorage/captures

Installation doesn't mention the AIS antennae at all

In installer, at drive setup, Nev entered "sda1" instead of just 1, and installer died because it didn't
get an int:

Enter drive number: sda1
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "photobot_installer.py", line 239, in <module>
    installer.main()
  File "photobot_installer.py", line 202, in main
    self.setup_drive()
  File "photobot_installer.py", line 105, in setup_drive
    dev_num = int( raw_input("Enter drive number: ") )
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'sda1'

Installer script, doesn't ask if you are using Lorex or Cannon/gphoto. Seems to install lorex stuff, but asks about gphoto tests.
installs gphoto version into crontab aswell, which I imagine will clog error log, since we aren't using it.

photobot_lorex.ini starts with capture_dir = /var/lorex should probably be /var/captures

Installation doesn't mention the AIS antennae at all

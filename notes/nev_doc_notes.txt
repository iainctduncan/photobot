Line 6: trailing "in this doc," seems like we stopped mid sentence?
Burn Image: for linux mint: (right click the .img file, and select "open with image writer"

Load into Pi: (Should maybe mention where in Pi the slot is?)

Alter the image to enable SSH:
 "on terminal in your host, get into the boot directory and execute: $ sudo touch ssh" might be hard for people to understand?
 Maybe mention the folder includes "kernel.img" is there an "open terminal here" option on mac

 Wifi Setup: Seemed confusing on adding the Wifi
  - "look for your network...." section, should maybe mention "copy the ESSID for the network you want to use"
  - "When explaning adding files, explain adding a bottom of the field"

After setting up wifi,
sudo ifdown wlano0 didn't work for me.

Had to use:
sudo ip link set wlan0 down
sudo ip link set wlan0 up
